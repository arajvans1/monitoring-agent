5-Line Technical Summary
We are building a modular AI-driven monitoring system for SAP S/4HANA on Azure, combining a custom Go-based agent with a natural language interface powered by an LLM.
The agent supports dynamic command execution across REST, SOAP, SQL, and Shell backends, with YAML-defined specs, parameter substitution, TTL-based caching, and structured logging.
A backend chatbot orchestrates queries via LLM function calling, sending monitoring requests in natural language that the agent translates to technical calls.
The LLM handles interpretation, context memory, and chain-of-thought reasoning to generate and refine queries.
This system bypasses SAP ALM for flexibility, lightweight deployment, and seamless cross-layer observability in distributed environments.

10-Line Technical Summary (More Detailed)
This project builds a lightweight, extensible monitoring platform for SAP S/4HANA systems hosted on Azure.
At its core is a custom Go-based agent capable of executing parameterized monitoring commands across SOAP, REST, SQL, and OS Shell backends.
All commands are defined declaratively via YAML, with runtime substitution, TTL-based caching, and auto-expiry supported.
The agent exposes a simple HTTP API, logs structured events using Zap, and maintains modular separation of backends with uniform Execute(command string) interfaces.
The system integrates with a backend chatbot and LLM, where user prompts in natural language are converted into structured queries via function calling.
The LLM parses intent, identifies the correct monitoring command, supplies required parameters, and interprets responses into human-readable summaries.
We avoided SAP Cloud ALM to retain fine-grained control, avoid heavy infrastructure, and support hybrid cloud deployments.
The agent’s design prioritizes zero external dependencies, fast startup, dynamic config reload, and safe concurrency patterns for production readiness.
Future extensions include Prometheus metrics, config hot-reload, and rule-based anomaly detection.
Overall, the platform enables conversational, AI-powered diagnostics across the full S/4HANA stack.


Requirements Specification Document: Custom Monitoring Agent for SAP S/4HANA 
1. Objective
The purpose of this project is to build a lightweight, extensible, intelligent agent that monitors SAP S/4HANA systems running on Azure. The agent is designed to:

Enable cross-layer monitoring across infrastructure, OS, SAP HANA DB, and application stack.

Expose a unified API that supports natural-language-driven monitoring requests.

Integrate with an LLM-based chatbot backend, which sends monitoring intent as structured JSON.

Execute commands defined declaratively in YAML, using multiple backends (Shell, REST, SOAP, SQL).

Provide flexible, parameterized, and secure access to system metrics and health signals.

Be self-contained, transparent, customizable, unlike SAP’s black-box ALM solutions.

2. Context & Motivation
SAP ALM tools like SAP Solution Manager and SAP Cloud ALM are feature-rich but have critical limitations:

Limitation	Our Rationale for Not Using SAP ALM
Heavyweight	Requires complex setup, dependencies, and resources.
Vendor Lock-in	Hard to integrate custom logic or hook into LLM/AI pipelines.
Poor Extensibility	Monitoring logic is hardcoded and not easily configurable via YAML or code.
Lack of Openness	ALM systems often lack transparent APIs and flexible transport mechanisms.
Slow Iteration	Modifying or extending ALM tooling is slow and cumbersome.
Cost Overhead	ALM introduces unnecessary infrastructure and licensing overheads.

Instead, our custom agent provides a simple, transparent, and modular architecture tailored to our specific use case of real-time LLM-driven monitoring and analytics.

       Shell  REST  SOAP  SQL Backends
       (e.g. OS) (e.g. HANA Stats) (e.g. /sap/monitoring) (e.g. HANA DB)

4. Features of the Monitoring Agent
A. Modular Backend Support
ShellBackend: Execute Linux shell commands (e.g., top, df, uptime).

RESTBackend: Call external REST APIs (e.g., Azure API for VM status).

SOAPBackend: Call SAP Start Service and Host Agent (e.g., CPU, Memory usage).

SQLBackend: Execute parameterized SQL queries on HANA or external DBs.

B. YAML-driven Command Definitions
Each command is defined declaratively in YAML.

Fields: backend, command, params, required.

Supports placeholder substitution (${param} syntax).

Example:

get_disk_usage:
  backend: shell
  command: "df -h ${mount}"
  params: ["mount"]
  required: ["mount"]
C. Unified API Interface
Single HTTP endpoint: /execute

Accepts structured JSON: { "command": "get_disk_usage", "params": { "mount": "/" } }

Response: { "result": ..., "error": ... }

D. Extensibility and Clean Architecture
Backends implement a common Backend interface.

handleExecute function delegates responsibilities cleanly:

parseRequest → parse HTTP + validate

prepareCommand → fill YAML templates

backend.Execute(cmdStr) → execute request

E. Other Features (Planned & Ongoing)
Background expiration support for cached metrics.

Concurrency-safe cache with optional TTL.

LRU eviction support (future).

Optional onEvict callbacks.

Configurable timeouts and retries per backend.

Connection pooling and reuse (SQL backend).

Pluggable metric exporters (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry) [Future].

5. Agent's Role in Overall Monitoring System
This agent is one of three components in the full system:

LLM + Chatbot Interface: Receives natural language queries, converts to structured command intent.

Monitoring Agent (this project): Executes backend operations using YAML specs and returns result.

Analytics/Visualization Layer (optional): Consumes agent responses for dashboards, anomaly detection, logs.

This design keeps the LLM decoupled from execution logic. The agent is trusted to execute defined, safe operations and return only pre-authorized data.

7. Still To Be Implemented
Authentication (JWT, API key).

Concurrency handling, request timeouts.

Background metrics collection for long-running stats.

Optional WebSocket streaming (for logs or health pulses).

Cache layer with expiration and eviction.

Role-based access control (RBAC).

CLI tool or gRPC wrapper (future).

8. Design Principles
Modular: Each backend is replaceable, testable, independently upgradable.

Declarative: All logic defined in YAML, not hardcoded.

Predictable: No arbitrary logic in LLM; only whitelisted commands can run.

Composable: Easy to wrap into a chatbot, scheduler, or monitoring pipeline.

Extensible: Future backends (SNMP, GraphQL, SSH) can plug in easily.

9. Summary
We are building a purpose-built, intelligent monitoring agent for SAP S/4HANA on Azure that:

Integrates naturally into LLM-based workflows.

Keeps execution logic modular, clean, and auditable.

Avoids the overhead of ALM while enabling flexible, programmable monitoring.

Has implemented all core backends with a uniform interface and minimal coupling.

Is positioned to become the central execution layer in a next-gen observability stack for SAP.
